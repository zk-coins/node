# Session state — pickup notes for the next agent

Read this first if you're picking up where the previous session
left off.

## Current branch + HEAD

`feat/plonky2-migration`, latest commit on `origin`: see `git log`.
PR [#17](https://github.com/zk-coins/server/pull/17) is the
mergeable migration PR with all 6 CI checks passing (Lint & Build,
Tests, Analyze rust, Analyze actions, CodeQL, Coverage MVP scope).

## Step status summary

- Steps 1–4: ✅ done
- Step 5 (monolithic circuit, all stages through 5d-next-5): ✅
  done. Stage 5d-next-5 source-side verification via aggregator
  pattern landed via PR [#23](https://github.com/zk-coins/server/pull/23)
  — Phase 1 (aggregator skeleton, `cc9c4b6` from PR #22) + Phase 2a
  (outer `verify_proof(aggregator)` + `connect_hashes` vk binding +
  `ConstantGate::new(2)` shape lock) + Phase 2b (per-slot SMT
  inclusion + SPEC §8 (c)(d)(e) chain + OCR coupling + active-bit
  binding) + Phase 3 (3 SPEC §13 source-side negatives). Two
  Plonky2 1.1.0 shape blockers resolved empirically (probe in
  [`src/circuit/recursion_shape_probe.rs`](src/circuit/recursion_shape_probe.rs)),
  end-state documented in
  [`MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md` §7.22](../MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md#722-stage-5d-next-5-source-side-verification-via-aggregator-pattern--codified-resolves-721).
- Step 6 (script-plonky2 prover host wrapper): ✅ done (`d96bb62`)
- Step 7 (server replacement): ✅ done. Workspace toolchain unified
  to nightly. `program/` + `script/` deleted (recoverable via
  `git checkout v0.last-sp1 -- ...`). shared + server fully
  migrated to Plonky2-era modules with the HashDigest type-shift
  handled at all boundaries. `account_server::send_coins` wired to
  the Plonky2 `Prover` wrapper (`c71c9fc`); the **in-circuit
  source-side validation** via `prove_*_and_sources` is wired
  through (Step 7 follow-up, addresses #25), with the off-circuit
  pre-check loop retained as **defense-in-depth fast-fail** before
  the minute-scale prove. Dockerfile re-introduced (`dac0179`). 120
  server tests pass with `--all-features` (32 baseline + 10 inline
  error-path in `d6a3cb9` + 64 ported SP1-era fixtures re-enabled
  via `account_server_tests.rs` + `server_tests.rs` + 13
  feature-gated + 1 new Stage 5d-next-5 Phase 2b negative). All
  surface verified end-to-end in release mode.
- Steps 8–9: ⏳ todo (App/Wallet integration + DEV deployment).
  Both require work outside this repo (`zk-coins/app` + deploy
  pipelines + SSH access to dfxdev/dfxprd).

## Smoke test verified

`cargo run --release -p server` boots cleanly:
- `Prover::new()` builds the cyclic state-transition circuit
- REST server binds `0.0.0.0:4242`
- `GET /health` → `ok`
- `GET /api/info` → `{"network":"Mutinynet"}`
- Block scanner connects to Esplora + processes Mutinynet tip
- No panics, no errors

## Active parallel work

None as of the post-PR-#26-merge state. Stage 5d-next-5 + the Step 7
in-circuit send_coins follow-up are both landed.

Remaining MVP-adjacent follow-ups (open, not blocking the user loop):

1. Drop the temporary CI coverage exclusions for `account_server.rs`
   + `server.rs` now that the in-circuit `send_coins` wiring is in
   and brings the previously-excluded surface back under the
   coverage gate.
2. Optional: include the Stage 5d-next-5 cyclic tests in CI by
   removing `--skip stage_5d --skip stage_5e` and bumping the
   `tests` job's `timeout-minutes` from 30 to ~120 (current local
   wall is ~42 min on M3 with `--test-threads=2`, so single-threaded
   on `ubuntu-latest` is ~80–120 min).
3. ✅ done — aggregator-pattern write-up folded into
   [`../MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md` §7.22](../MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md#722-stage-5d-next-5-source-side-verification-via-aggregator-pattern--codified-resolves-721)
   in the Issue #28 housekeeping pass; standalone tracker file deleted.

## What works end-to-end

The monolithic state-transition circuit at
[`src/circuit/main.rs`](src/circuit/main.rs) implements **the full
SPEC §8 predicate including source-side verification of in-coins**
(Stage 5d-next-5):

- Initial-branch predicate (mint exception, empty SMT roots).
- AccountUpdate branch with cyclic recursion, SPEC §8 (a)+(b).
- Prev-account `CommitmentMerkleProofs` (c)+(d)+(e) via fixed-shape
  SMT + 2× MMR inclusion gadgets.
- `MAX_IN_COINS = 8` in-coin slots with SMT non-inclusion + insert
  into `coin_history_root` and full `apply_coin` semantics
  (recipient check + balance overflow check via `split_le(sum, 33)`).
- **Per in-coin slot — Stage 5d-next-5 Phase 2b — source-side**:
  - Strict `connect(slot.active, aggregator.slot[i].active_pi)` —
    no in-coin can be consumed without a verified source proof.
  - SMT inclusion of `coin.identifier` in
    `source.output_coins_root`.
  - OCR coupling: `source.output_coins_root ==
    source_cmp.commitment_out_coins_root`.
  - SPEC §8 (c)(d)(e) chain for source's commitment in the outer's
    `history_root` (mirrors the prev-account CMP gates).
- `MAX_OUT_COINS = 8` out-coin slots with SMT non-inclusion + insert
  into `output_coins_root`, balance subtraction with underflow check
  via `split_le(diff, 64)`, identifier derivation
  (`out_coin.identifier == Poseidon(interim_asth || u32(index))`)
  and pubkey rotation.
- `INNER_PAD_BITS_STAGE_5D_NEXT_5 = 15` (1 << 15 = 32 768 gates in
  the helper, matching the ~50 k outer circuit gates' degree 16 via
  `helper_degree = pad_bits + 1`).

## What's deferred to post-MVP

Nothing in the state-transition circuit itself is deferred — Stage
5d-next-5 landed (PR [#23](https://github.com/zk-coins/server/pull/23))
and all three previously-off-circuit SPEC §13 source-side negatives
are now covered in-circuit (`stage_5d_next_5_phase_3_*` tests).

Pre-mainnet protocol redesigns remain (see ROADMAP "Pre-mainnet
blockers"): D2/D10 (recipient hiding), D7 (reorg safety), D8
(per-coin nullifier-accum). These are real protocol changes, not
implementation gaps.

## Test count + budget

At Stage 5d-next-5 / Phase 2b production parameters
(`MAX_IN_COINS = MAX_OUT_COINS = 8`,
`INNER_PAD_BITS_STAGE_5D_NEXT_5 = 15`):

- `program-plonky2` lib: 117 tests total (115 default-run + 2
  `#[ignore]`d `recursion_shape_probe` diagnostics). Of the 115
  default-run, ~39 are cyclic-recursion tests (build the
  state-transition + aggregator circuits and prove), the remainder
  exercise off-circuit gadgets (Poseidon / SMT / MMR / types /
  inputs). `cargo test --release --lib -- --test-threads=2` wall
  ~42 min on M3. Single-threaded ~80–120 min on `ubuntu-latest`.
- `server` crate: 120 tests with `--all-features` (32 baseline + 10
  inline error-path + 64 ported SP1-era fixtures + 13 feature-gated
  + 1 Stage 5d-next-5 Phase 2b negative). `cargo test -p server
  --release --all-features -- --test-threads=1` wall ~36 min on M3.

A serial workspace sweep at `--test-threads=1` is several hours.
Default multi-thread is bounded by RAM (~2 GB per test).

`cargo llvm-cov --fail-under-lines 100 -- --test-threads=1` is the
coverage gate. The CI workflow currently excludes
`account_server.rs` + `server.rs` from the gate while the in-circuit
`send_coins` refactor was in progress; with the refactor landed
(this branch), the exclusions can be dropped — see "Files most
likely to be touched next" above.

## Files most likely to be touched next

1. [`../.github/workflows/ci.yaml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yaml) —
   drop the temporary coverage exclusions for `account_server.rs` +
   `server.rs`; optionally include the Stage 5d-next-5 cyclic tests
   by removing `--skip stage_5d --skip stage_5e` and bumping the
   `tests` job's `timeout-minutes` from 30 to ~120.
2. Steps 8–9 in [`../ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md): App/wallet Schnorr
   signing integration + DEV deployment + Signet end-to-end
   roundtrip. Both span repos outside this one (`zk-coins/app` plus
   deploy pipelines / SSH to dfxdev/dfxprd).
3. ✅ done — empirical insights from the Stage 5d-next-5 aggregator
   work now live in
   [`../MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md` §7.22](../MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md#722-stage-5d-next-5-source-side-verification-via-aggregator-pattern--codified-resolves-721).
   Tracker file removed in the Issue #28 housekeeping pass.

## Things explicitly NOT in this branch

- App / wallet integration (Step 8).
- DEV deployment (Step 9).
- Pre-mainnet protocol redesigns (D2/D10 / D7 / D8 — see
  ROADMAP "Pre-mainnet blockers").

Step 6 (`script-plonky2/` prover host) and Step 7 (server-side
replacement + in-circuit `send_coins` follow-up) have BOTH landed
on this branch.

## Test confirmation status

**Historical snapshot (Stage 5d-next-3 era, `INNER_PAD_BITS = 14`).**
Kept for the wall-time reference points; the current branch is at
`INNER_PAD_BITS_STAGE_5D_NEXT_5 = 15` for the Phase 2b outer.

| Test | Confirmed | Run notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stage_5d_initial_with_one_active_in_coin` | ✅ | 188 s wall, single in-coin |
| `stage_5d_next_3_initial_with_one_active_out_coin` | ✅ | 761 s wall, single out-coin |
| `stage_5d_next_3_initial_combined_in_and_out_coin` | ✅ | 781 s wall, both loops active |
| `stage_5d_next_3_account_update_combined_in_and_out_coin` | ✅ | 926 s wall, both loops + cyclic recursion + CMP (b)(c)(d)(e) chain |

**Current branch (Stage 5d-next-5 / Phase 2b landed).** Full
`program-plonky2` lib sweep ~42 min wall on M3 with
`--test-threads=2`, 115 cyclic-recursion tests green; full server
sweep `cargo test -p server --release --all-features --
--test-threads=1` ~36 min wall, 120 tests green (including the
Phase 2b negative `test_send_coins_rejects_tampered_source_proof_inclusion`).
See [`../MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md` §7.22 "Benchmark"](../MIGRATION_RESEARCH.md#722-stage-5d-next-5-source-side-verification-via-aggregator-pattern--codified-resolves-721)
for the per-test wall-time breakdown.

## Next session — verification checklist

Before adding new features:

1. `git fetch && git pull --ff-only origin feat/plonky2-migration`
   — pull any parallel work.
2. `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` — should be a no-op
   build after the cache warms.
3. `cargo fmt --all --check` and `cargo clippy --workspace
   --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
4. `cargo test -p server --release --all-features -- --test-threads=1`
   — 120 tests, ~36 min wall on M3.
5. `cargo test -p zkcoins-program-plonky2 --release --lib --
   --test-threads=2` — 115 cyclic tests, ~42 min wall on M3.
6. `cargo llvm-cov --fail-under-lines 100 --
   --test-threads=1` — coverage gate (after dropping the temporary
   `account_server.rs` + `server.rs` exclusions from
   `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`).

If any test fails: bisect against the commit list in
[`../ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md) Done section.

After confirmation: Steps 8–9 (App/wallet Schnorr signing
integration + DEV deployment + Signet end-to-end roundtrip).
